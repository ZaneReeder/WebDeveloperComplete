Cascading Style Sheets
	Presentation Focused
	Modify HTML tags, so as to deliver branded experience in graphical browsers.
	Graceful Degradation
	
Style Rule
	allows author specify formatting and presentation
	ex:
		h1{
			font-size: 24px;
			font-family: Helvetica;
			color: blue;
		}


Selectors
	targets a specific HTML element

Properties
	within the curlys
	font-size
	font-family
	...
	
Values
	assigned to the property
	24px
	helvetica
	blue
	...


Inheritance of Styles

	<h1>Hey, <em>look</em> at that monkey</h1>

	<h1> -> parent of <em>
	Thus any modifications to h1 will affect em.
	Called inheritance
	Some exceptions like borders.


Measurements and Box Model

	Margin Padding Font size width height....
	
	Unit	description
	
	px		pixels
	
	%		percent
	
	em		relative to font size of parent. I
			If parent has fontsize of 14px, 1em = 14px
	
	rem		relative to font size of root.
			if the html element is 18px, then 1rem = 18px
			
	
	Box Model
	All elements in HTML appear in a box in the layout of page.
	All boxes have a margin, padding, and borders.
	Block level elements have a width property where as inline-level
	elements do not.
	
	Margins

	Margins live outside the box. Top & Bottom margins overlap on adjacent elements.
	If you have an h3 followed by an h4, and you defined the h3 to have a margin
	bottom of 30px, and the h4 to have a margin top of 10px.The two margins overlap
	and the larger of the two margins is used. Thus the 30px margin is used.
	
	Inline elements have left and right margins.
	
	margin-top:	x	
	margin-bottom: x	]- 	margin: x
	margin-left: x
	margin-right: x
	
	or
	
	margin: topX rightX bottomX leftX;
	
	margin: top&bottomX left&rightX;
	
	margin: topX left&rightX bottomX;
	
	
	This applies to padding and borders as well.
	
	border-style
	border-width	]-	border:style width color
	border-color
	
	Specific Modifications
	border: solid 4px #333
	border-bottom-color: #fc3
	
	
	
CSS Specificity
	
	In order to reduce problems with large CSS files we use the Specificity Rule.
	
	The Specificity Rule
		More Specific = Higher Precedence
