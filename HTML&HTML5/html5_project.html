					<dt><h5>Dominion</h5></dt>
					<dd>This is an amazing card-drafting and deck-building game with a 
					medieval setting. You start with a small hand(kingdom) of money and 
					land, and by using your small resources effectively, your goal is to
					acquire the most land. This game is great for all 2-4, but 1v1 is
					definitely its own type game.</dd>
					
					<dt><h5>Settlers of Catan</h5></dt>
					<dd>An awesome card and board game with resource management as the main
					mechanic. Everyone starts off small with just two settlements and a few
					resource tiles to draw from, but by the end cities and roads hundreds of
					miles long stretch across the newly settled island of Catan. Great for 3
					to 4. 1v1 is not recommended.</dd>
					
					<dt><h5>Dead of Winter</h5></dt>
					<dd>This game starts as cooperative with the colony against the harsh 
					Elements of Winter and Zombies. But there is always the lurking suspicion
					of a Betrayer among the colony, who secretly seeks its demise. This intense
					management coop game makes the players feel as though they are in the middle
					of an apocalypse colony situation. This game is meant for 3-6. But there is
					a possible 2 player version that is strictly coop without a betrayer. Highly
					recommend this game for patient gamers that like to play long games. Our average
					session would last at least two hours.

				<h2>Texas Tech University Review</h2>

			<section class = "article_body">
				<p>Scarlet Red flows through my blood after attending Texas Tech University
				for four consecutive years. This coming spring semester of 2018 will be last
				as a Red Raider. I feel I have learned so much about life and my studies in
				these last four years than I can really comprehend. Texas Tech University is
				a great school and it's only getting better. Do they spend too much money on
				athletics? Of course they do, but so does every other college in the south
				with a decent Division I football team. But, Texas Tech is growing quickly, and
				the administration is noticing the lack of professors and desire for better
				learning. The students at Tech are definitely rowdy and love Broadway.
